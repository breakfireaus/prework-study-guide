          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertedxt Markup Language </li>
          <li>We need a frame to be able to build a house, so does a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is the frame.</li>
          <li>The Head is not the visible part, the body is content the user sees.</li>
          <li>H1 should only appear once on a page.</li>
          <li>Section elements help to organise the content.</li>
          <li>HTML is a Language</li>
          <li>We can use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. </li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
