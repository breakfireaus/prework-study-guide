# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The website is a collection of notes for topics I am learning in my Course

- What motivated me to do this was the need for learning and career change.
- I built this project so I could understand how to build a website, and in order to do that I had to learn what HTML, CSS, Javascript, Github and Deployment is. 
- The website has some notes and gives me my notes that I have written for HTML, CSS, Javascript and Deployment
- I learnt how to write code, create a repositry locally and on github. furthermore, I learnt how to create HTML for my frame of my website, and write an external style sheet, I also learnt the IF function and how to log, also I learnt how to randomly select a topic, arrays and strings for running functions.

It was challenging but I did it!! I created a guide!!
